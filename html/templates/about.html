        <p>I’m a UX Designer crazy about new technologies and creating friendly and easy to use interfaces. I love to go surfing early in the morning to start my day replenished and ready for the challenges that comes up. I am married to Luísa, a psychologist who is always teaching me new things about emotional intelligence and we have a son, Dante, my happy baby that is showing me a different side of life.</p>
        <p>I want to find an amazing company that values me as a human being and can help me grow as a UX Designer. I’m looking for a mature design team where I can learn and improve my skills.</p>
