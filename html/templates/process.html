              <h3>Lean UX</h3>
              <p>Lean UX is all about understanding the problem and generating solutions to validate hypothesis. This is done by building MVPs (minimum viable prototypes) to test, getting feedback from real users to learn and evolve, in a cycle of continuous improvement and incremental design.</p>
